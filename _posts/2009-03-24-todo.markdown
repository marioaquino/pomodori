title: extracting controllers
---

TODAY's PLANNED 9
---------------

TODAY's DONE
------------
* modularization manual acceptance UI plus fixing button actions plus add test coverage 4 => 4
* modularization move models to models and controllers to controllers plus renaming 2 => 2

TODAY's NOT DONE
----------------
* Charts

STANDUP
-------
* I was able to close with the main refactoring operations like extracting controllers and fix the test suite
* I started manual acceptance of the new GUI and there are button actions to fix
* Today: keep going with the manual acceptance until everything works and create test to cover the fix, commit a working app.
* Final refactoring: rename countdown field, move pomodoro to models, delete useless old wrapper UI classes and commit again
* Everything should be ready for the next session to start working again on charts.
* Be careful with breaks and longer breaks

POMOSPECTIVE
------------
* Had session abort 2 hours before expected. Nothing I can do about it right now.
* I was good with estimates to close the refactoring
* I was strict with 5 mins break: did nothing.

INTERNAL INTERRUPTIONS
----------------------

EXTERNAL INTERRUPTIONS
----------------------
* Several quick IM message exchange
* Abort session

RAW DUMP
