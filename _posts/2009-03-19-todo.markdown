TODAY's PLANNED 6
-----------------
* modularization take some time to understand how much work still to be done and fill a task list to close in 6 pomodoros 1

TODAY's DONE
------------

TODAY's NOT DONE
----------------

STANDUP
-------
* Skipped a day, no time to work.
* I started to see the light of the refactoring but I still have an hard time figuring out how much work is to be done.
* Could it be a good idea to timebox the work. Today is the last day of pure refactoring

RETROSPECTIVE
-------------
* Planned 9, actually done 7
* Estimates are too high level, need to split in multiple tasks.
* Decided to remove the 1 pomodoro for planning I add everyday for clarity. I just need to shoot for 1 pomodoro less than usual.
