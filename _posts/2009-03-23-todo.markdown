title: closing huge refactoring (hopefully)
---

TODAY's PLANNED 6
---------------

TODAY's DONE 6
------------
* modularization modal button controller with on click methods for submit, void, stop and callbacks to main view to change labels 4 => 5
* modularization summary controller to control statistics display with update-summary and format-metrics 2 => 1

TODAY's NOT DONE
----------------

STANDUP
-------
* I was taking a convolute path when I saw a state machine in the modal button controller. That's BDUF and not the simplest thing.

POMOSPECTIVE
-------------
* Forced to abort current pomodoro and session for external problems.
* Forcing brain relaxing activities during the break. No more mails/rss, plus standup from chair.
* Going easy on long break to avoid brain draining.
