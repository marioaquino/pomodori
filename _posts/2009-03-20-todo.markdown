title: controllers refactoring
---

TODAY's PLANNED 9
---------------

TODAY's DONE 5
------------
* planning 1 => 1
* modularization migrate on-pomodoro-done and on-break-done and on-app-start to the countdown-field soon to be timer-controller and update test suite for it 4 => 4

TODAY's NOT DONE
----------------
* modularization summary controller to control statistics display with update-summary and format-metrics 2
* modularization modal button controller with on click methods for submit, void, stop and callbacks to main view to change labels 2

STANDUP
-------
* I was able to split the refactoring operations into multiple tasks and that worked out very well.
* I moved 90% of the timer logic out of application.rb into the timer-controller
* I had to move also the enabling/disabling logic out of the text field class
* I still need to extract the on-break-down method
* Today I'll try to close the timer controller (the renaming is basically the final action)
* Then I want to extract the other logics

RETROSPECTIVE
-------------
* I was slower because I mixed two different tasks: extracting timer controller logic and creating a main view in parallel. I should have extracted the controller logic from application.rb leaving all the rest and then extracting or renaming application.rb to mainview. Remember next time.

INTERNAL INTERRUPTIONS
----------------------

EXTERNAL INTERRUPTIONS
----------------------
* Session aborted to go home fix Palomino
