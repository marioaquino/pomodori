TODAY's DONE 7
------------
* \@planning 1 => 1
* \@charts The chart-controller is called by the view to obtain the chart url or reload/close operations and the alike 2 => 2 (Missing: reload button should reload and open report from the main view should always work)

* \@chirb presentation part two, pomodoro technique intro 1
* \@chirb presentation part three, pomodori app, testing challenge, architecture 2

STANDUP
-------
* today should be able to close release 0.2 with the simple chart working properly.
* There is a fix to be done in the way the chart is loaded everytime
* The reload button is not working now

POMOSPECTIVE
------------
* I thought I could close the day later, I had to close it before the exp. time
* So estimates are right.

INTERNAL INTERRUPTIONS
----------------------
* I found interesting examples of MacRuby apps, I couldn't resist to have a look.

EXTERNAL INTERRUPTIONS
