TODAY's PLANNED 6
---------------

TODAY's DONE 4
------------
* \@charts chart model to complete with actual processing of template 1 => 1 (not finished yet)
* \@charts Need to finish the pomodoro by count model by returning a collection of pomodoro-by-count models 1 => 1
* \@charts Need to add attributes to pomodoro-by-count model to hold relevant data 1 => 0
* \@charts Need to change chart-view to use new chart controller to create URL 1 => 1

TODAY's NOT DONE
----------------
* \@charts chart model to complete with actual processing of template 1 => 1 (not finished yet)
* \@marketing @website better screenshot for the website, formatting of raw dump section in the blog 1
* \@charts The chart-controller is called by the view to obtain the chart url or reload/close operations and the alike 2

STANDUP
-------
* Panera session, noisy but doable.
* Should be able to close charting today, only details are missing but the design is down
* I envisioned a collaboration between the view asking to open an URL which is generated by a chart component.
* The chart component uses an aggregated pomodoro count by day model object
* I need a chart controller I don't want the view to know anything about URL generation logic. Just a plain call.

POMOSPECTIVE
------------
* I just assumed I had 6 pomodoros available but those were really only 5
* Worked very well on breaks, I looked out the window, that's it
