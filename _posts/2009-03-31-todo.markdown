* \@build commit, test, build automation just a bit 1 => 1


TODAY's NOT DONE
----------------
* \@charts The chart-controller is called by the view to obtain the chart url or reload/close operations and the alike 2 => 1 (Missing: reload button should reload and open report from the main view should always work)
* \@marketing \@website better screenshot for the website, release 0.2 1

STANDUP
-------
* Was almost done with chart processing last session
* Today closing summary chart basics and probably there will be some tweaking next days

POMOSPECTIVE
------------
* Couldn't break very well today, feel the pressure of the incoming presentations and the fact that I don't know how much time I have available per day these days
